class UpdateSubscriptionsForNewValidityStructure < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def up
    # This migration attempted to add columns (validity, start_date, end_date, amount)
    # and update plan_type, but its logic was flawed (type mismatch with plan_type).
    # Since the subscriptions table is empty in production and the schema has been
    # updated by a later migration (20250512085033 UpdateSubscriptionsSchema),
    # we can make this a no-op to avoid conflicts.

  def down
    # No-op for rollback.
